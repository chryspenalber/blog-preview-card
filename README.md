## My Process

My process for this challenge involved structuring the page with semantic HTML and applying CSS for styling, layout, and responsiveness. I focused on proper spacing, typography, and hover effects to enhance user experience.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

**Semantic HTML Tags Used:**

```html
<main>
<img>
<header>
<h1>
<h2>
<p>
<div>
<footer>
```

**CSS Features:**

- **Custom Properties (CSS Variables):** Used to define a color scheme for easy customization.
- **Typography:**
  - Imported and applied the "Figtree" font from local assets.
  - Defined various font weights and sizes for consistency.
- **Box Model Adjustments:**
  - Applied `margin`, `padding`, and `border-radius` for proper element spacing.
  - Used `box-shadow` for a subtle 3D effect, enhancing the card's aesthetics.
- **Hover Effects:**
  - The cardâ€™s shadow increases on hover.
  - The title changes color when hovered.

### What I Learned

This project helped me practice working with:

- Custom fonts using `@font-face`.
- CSS transitions for smooth hover effects.
- Utilizing `clamp()` for responsive typography.
- Implementing a structured and scalable design approach.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in:

- Implementing more interactive elements using JavaScript.
- Enhancing accessibility features.
- Experimenting with advanced CSS animations and transitions.
